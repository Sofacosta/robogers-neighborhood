## Project Description
This is my indepentent project to showcase the lesson learned last week: Arrays and Loops. It is an application that will take a number from a user and will return a range of numbers and statements using arrays and loops. A user should be able to enter a new number and see different results over and over again. 
## Specs

```
Describe: beepBop()
Test: "It should return an array of numbers inputted by the user including the number 0"
Expect(beepBoop(08234)).toEqual(["08234"]);

Describe: beepBop()
Test:"It should return "Beep!" when number 1 is inputted in any given number" 
Expect(beepBoop(1)).toEqual(["Beep!"])

Describe: beepBop()
Test:"It should return "Boop!" when number 2 is inputted in any given number"
Expect(beepBop(2)).toEqual(["Boop!"])

Describe: beepBop()
Test:"It should return "Won't you be my neighbor?" when number 3 is inputted in any given number"
Expect(beepBop(3)).toEqual(["Won't you be my neighbor?"])

Describe: beepBop()
Test:"It should create a new array with inputted number"
Expect(beepBop(54)).toEqual(["54"])
